/**
 * Report here:
 *
 * What are the runtimes for each of the 5 calls above?
 * Can you explain the differences in runtime for computing
 * perfect numbers within the first 10,000 elements?
 
 * 1 thread / 10000 items = 0.202085
 * 1 thread / 1 item = 0.221015
 * 4 threads / 1 item = 0.155982
 * 4 threads / 100 items = 0.0669439
 * 4 threads / 100 items = 7.44264
 
 The first two calls take basically the same amount of time because it is only one thread doing all the work. In fact, the one thread with 1 item at a time will take a bit longer due to the extra time it takes to lock and unlock. The 4 threads doing 1 item each is faster because there are multiple threads working on the same amount of work so it is dividing up the work. However, it is still slower than the 4 threads doing 100 items because by only doing 1 item, the threads have to wait for the other thread to finish its work. The 4 threads doing 100 items at a time is optimal because it allows for the multiple threads to work and has a very low wait time to start the next task. Finally, the last call is significantly longer because it is a larger input.
